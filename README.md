# SnakeGame
This is the classic 8-bit snake game created using HTML5, css, JavaScript and JSON. This game also includes some 8-bit music and sounds while maintaining the old classic fun. Here are some of the features of the game:

8 Bit graphics just like the classic one.
Speed of the snake increases as you progress.
Classic 8-Bit Retro Music.
Easy to lean, hard to master!

The goal of Snake is to create a snake as long as possible. This is achieved by guiding the
snake to an apple on the game board. The snake cannot stop moving, and dies whenever
it hits something (excluding foods). Because the snake is growing longer and longer as
the game progresses, it gets increasingly difficult to avoid collisions with the snake itself.
The player can change the direction of the head of the snake by using the arrow keys. At
step in the game, there is always an apple somewhere on the board. If the snake eats an
apple, the snake becomes one cell longer per step. A new food is placed on
a random location, excluding all places covered by the snake. When the snake reaches
an end of the game board, it re-emerges at the opposite end.
